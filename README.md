ManageIQ plugin for the OpenStack provider.

## Development

See the section on plugins in the [ManageIQ Developer Setup](http://manageiq.org/docs/guides/developer_setup/plugins)

For quick local setup run `bin/setup`, which will clone the core ManageIQ repository under the *spec* directory and setup necessary config files. If you have already cloned it, you can run `bin/update` to bring the core ManageIQ code up to date.

### VCR cassettes re-recording

You will need testing OpenStack environment(s) and `openstack_environments.yml` file with credentials in format like:

```yml
---
- test_env_1:
    ip: 11.22.33.44
    password: long_password_1
    user: admin_1
- test_env_2:
    ip: 11.22.33.55
    password: long_password_2
    user: admin_2
```

Then you can run `bundle exec rake vcr:rerecord` and following will happen:
* Current VCR cassettes files will be deleted
* Credentials from `openstack_environments.yml` file will be injected into spec files
* Specs needed for re-recording of VCR cassettes will be run. During this step manageiq will call OpenStack APIs at specified endpoints
* Credentials present in spec files and VCR cassettes will be changed to dummy data so tests can run from VCR cassettes
